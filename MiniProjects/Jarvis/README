# Jarvis Personal Assistant

A voice-controlled personal assistant built in Python using speech recognition and Windows SAPI for text-to-speech. Jarvis listens for a wake word, processes simple commands to open websites, and responds verbally.

---

## 🔍 Features

* **Wake Word Detection**: Listens for the keyword "Jarvis" to activate.
* **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken commands into text using the Google Speech Recognition API.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Speaks responses through Windows SAPI (COM interface) for reliable audio output.
* **Command Execution**: Opens popular websites (YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter/X, GitHub, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT).
* **Ambient Noise Calibration**: Adapts to background noise for improved recognition accuracy.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Windows OS (for SAPI COM interface)
* Python 3.8+ installed
* Conda (optional) or virtual environment support

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone this repo** (inside `python_tutorial/MiniProject/jarvis`):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArshhAnsari/python_tutorial.git
   cd python_tutorial/MiniProject/jarvis
   ```
2. **Create and activate a Conda environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create -n jarvis python=3.11
   conda activate jarvis
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
conda activate jarvis       # if created a virtual environment, then activate your environment
python main.py            # else execute this command to start the assistant
```

1. On startup, Jarvis will announce **"Initializing Jarvis"**.
2. Speak the wake word **"Jarvis"** clearly into your microphone.
3. After Jarvis responds **"Yes, Sir?"**, speak one of the supported commands:

   * **Open YouTube**
   * **Open Google**
   * **Open Facebook**
   * **Open Twitter** (X)
   * **Open GitHub**
   * **Open StackOverflow**
   * **Open ChatGPT**
4. Jarvis will open the requested site in your default web browser and confirm verbally.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

* **Volume & Rate**: Adjust `speaker.Volume` (0–100) and `speaker.Rate` (–10 to +10) in `jarvis.py`.
* **Ambient Calibration**: Tweak `adjust_for_ambient_noise` duration for different noise levels.
* **Add Commands**: Extend the `process_command` function with new `elif` blocks to handle more tasks.
