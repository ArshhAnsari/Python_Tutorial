# Quick conceptual notes:

# -> Employee.__num_of_emps is a private (name-mangled) class variable; it is incremented when each Employee is created.
# -> @staticmethod def print_num_of_emps() prints the private counter; it doesn't receive self or cls.
# -> @staticmethod def is_weekday(day) returns a boolean telling whether the provided date is a weekday.
# -> Static methods are ideal when you need a function inside the class namespace but don't need access
#    to instance or class state (i.e., no self / cls).
